Rainbow is C++ library for cryptographic schemes.

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/Licence-MIT-blue.svg)](https://github.com/utilForever/CubbyFlow/blob/master/LICENSE)

## Key Features

- Authenticated encryption schemes
- High speed stream ciphers
- AES and AES candidates
- Other block ciphers
- Block cipher modes of operation
- Message authentication codes
- Hash functions
- Public-key cryptography
- Padding schemes for public-key systems
- Key agreement schemes
- Elliptic curve cryptography
- Insecure or obsolescent algorithms retained for backwards compatibility and historical value

## Other Features

- Pseudo random number generators (PRNG)
- Password based key derivation functions
- Shamir's secret sharing scheme and Rabin's information dispersal algorithm (IDA)
- Fast multi-precision integer (bignum) and polynomial operations
- Finite field arithmetics, including GF(p) and GF(2^n)
- Prime number generation and verification
- Useful non-cryptographic algorithms
- Class wrappers for these platform and operating system features (optional)
- A high level interface for most of the above, using a filter/pipeline metaphor
- Benchmarks and validation testing
- x86, x64 (x86-64), x32 (ILP32), ARM-32, Aarch32, Aarch64 and Power8 in-core code for the commonly used algorithms
